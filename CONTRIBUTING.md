# Thank you for considering contributing!
This project is about community, so your prescence and consideration means a lot!

## This is a baby project
We don't have crazy contributing guidelines (yet). Follow this process:
1. Create or select an issue. If you select one, choose one that's tagged `todo` or `backlog`. Prioritize issues tagged `todo`. If you create an issue, wait for a contributor to mark it with a `todo` or `backlog` tag, or to respond with a comment.
2. Write failing tests (if this is a new feature or if the tests are lacking). Test coverage is very important to ensure changes can be made in the future safely. 
3. Write the code! Try to follow the [Flutter style guidelines](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo) and the general style of the repo itself. 
4. Create a pull request with the fix/feature! Mention the issue in the pull request. 
5. A contributor will review the pull request. They may request some changes, or may simply accept the PR. 
6. Once your PR is accepted, you will be added to the AUTHORS file for your hard work.
7. Thank you!

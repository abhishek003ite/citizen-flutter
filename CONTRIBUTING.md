# Thank you for considering contributing!
This project is about community, so your prescence and consideration mean a lot!

## This is a baby project
We don't have crazy contributing guidelines (yet). For now, follow this process:
1. Create or select an issue. If you select one, choose one that's tagged `todo` or `backlog`. Prioritize issues tagged `todo`. If you create an issue, wait for a contributor to mark it with a `todo` or `backlog` tag, or to respond with a comment.
2. Write failing tests (if this is a new feature or if the tests are lacking). Test coverage is very important to ensure that we can make changes safely in the future. 
3. Write the code! Try to follow the [Flutter style guidelines](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo), the [Dart guidelines](https://www.dartlang.org/guides/language/effective-dart/style), and the general style of the repo itself. A contributor may request changes if the style is too inconsistent from these guidelines.
4. Create a pull request with the fix/feature! Mention the issue in the pull request. 
5. A contributor will review the pull request. They may request some changes, or may simply accept the PR. 
6. Once your PR is accepted, you will be added to the AUTHORS file for your awesome hard work!
7. Thank you!

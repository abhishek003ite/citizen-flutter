# ActWorthy
This is the ActWorthy app for citizen users (anyone who is not an organization or activist). 

## What is ActWorthy?
Our mission is to help people deepen their relationship with their community through action. ActWorthy is social media for social change. We are creating the platform that makes people feel compelled to take action in their community. "Action" might include donating, volunteering, or any community-oriented action you can think of. At its core, ActWorthy is a feed of actions you can take to impact the issues you care about in the community you live in.

## Why social media for social change?
The current media ecosystem is designed for collective consumption, not collective action. It is designed for decentralized friend groups, families, and colleagues. ActWorthy is facilitating collective action in your city, district, county, and state. Social change requires new ways of communicating and coordinating action. We want ActWorthy to be the platform for that.

## What makes people want to take action to make their community better?
- Discovering what actions they can take
- Having empathy for people impacted by a cause or issue (often from personal experience)
- Believing that their action makes a difference
- Seeing friends, family, and community members taking action
- Viewing the action as simple, achievable, and frictionless
- Knowing the impact of previous actions
- Gaining appreciation and social cache for taking action
- Receiving rewards or credit for taking action
 
> We are building the platform that reinforces these dynamics. We need your help to make these real. We want your ideas for how to encourage more action.

## Why is this an open source project?
ActWorthy is about building community. We believe the best way to build community is through a community of developers who want to help people make change. As developers, we know that code is our preferred way of contributing. ActWorthy is a great way to work together to **make change through code**.


## Tech stack
**Flutter (Dart 2) and Redux**

This is a cross platform app built with Google's [Flutter](https://flutter.io/) SDK. Flutter is a reactive framework that is modeled after Facebook's React. With that in mind Redux, makes sense for handling the fairly complex state this app entails.

## Filing Issues
At least for now, there aren't any strict guidelines about this. Just try to be specific and clear, and file away :) One of the contributors will get to it and respond to or tag it. 

If you'd like, feel free to write the fix yourself once a contributor approves the issue for fixing (by tagging it with the `todo` or `backlog` labels). For more information on contributing, see the [contributing](https://github.com/actworthy/citizen-flutter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide! 

Thank you for your help!
